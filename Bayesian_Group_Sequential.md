Adaptive Design
========================================================
- What is adaptive design?
  <!--- Add the flow chart from Adaptive Design Paper here-->
  - results from interim data analyses are used to modify the ongoing trial, without undermining its integrity or validity <!--- definiing characteristic of all ADs--->
  - pre-specifed changes can be made based on analyses of accumulating data whilst maintaining the _validity_ and _integrity_ of the trial
  <!--- Possible expantion to definition of validity and integrity--->
  - __no unplanned ad hoc modifications__

Adaptive Design
========================================================  
- why we want to use adaptive design?
  - __Flexibility__ \(\Rightarrow\) efficient trials
  - bullet 2
- When to use adaptive design?
  - Can be used in Phase I - Phase III
  - bullet 2
- How to use adaptive design?
  - It is possible to use in combination

- What design we talked about are adaptive desig?
  - CRM
  - E-WOC

Adaptive Design
========================================================  
  
- What for? Include but are not limited to
  - refinning the sample size <!--- Add the desing here--->
  - Abandoning treatments or doeses
  - Changing the allocation ratio of patients to trail arms
  - identifying patients most likely to benefit and focusing recruitment efforts
on them
  - stopping the whole trial at an early stage for success or lack of efficacy
  - rapid transitioning between phases [Seamless phase I/II, Seamless phase II/III]






  


Group Sequential Design
========================================================
 <!--- In relationship to Adaptive design: -->
 - _Group Sequential_ \(\in\) _Adpative Design_

Issues of Adaptive Design
========================================================
- statistical issues
  - biased estimation using navie methods for fixed design trials
  <!--- early stop fior futility, biased upwards--->
  <!--- add Table 2 in adaptive design here--->
  - incorrect converage for confidence interval
  - p-value
  - Type I error rate
  - Multiple hypothesis testing: also report frequentist charactereistics
  - Bayesina statistics
- Non-statistical issues
  - the possibly of introducing optional bias
  <!--- the interium analysis for block design to check balance--->
  - Explaining the heterogeneity between the stages of an AD trial

Bayesian Clinical Trial
========================================================
- what is Bayesian Clinical Trial
  <!--- Bayesian Leaning statistian-->
  -Personally, it is any clinical trial that relies on Bayesian methods for either the design or the analysis or both
- what about bayesian
  - Biggest distinct of bayesian methods comparing to Freqentist method, we are treating the parameter of interest as a random variable instead of unknown constant, so we can talk about the probability of the paramater directly.
  \(\mathbb{P}(\theta|\text{data})\)
- why Bayesian clinical trial is useful
- How we can use it
- when to use it we want to use it

Reporting Adaptive Design
========================================================
- Something need to to report to make
<!--- go back to Reproting adaptive designs from adpative design paper--->
- Consort statement for AD


Practical Aspects of ADs
=======================================================
- Obtaining funding: convince the design is appropriate due to non familiar-> non-techinical terms, show advantages over non-adaptive designs, recommending review
<!--- other questions might be asked what you gonna do if the study stops early--->
<!--- EU and US guidlines on ADs--->

- communicating the design to trail stakeholders/participants: A lot of questions-> independent statistical expert to confirm (stakeholders), prepare a good informaiton sheet(participants)

- IDMC and trial steering committee roles: -> Integrity: keep people with a vested intrerest strictly blinded to alleviate the possiblity of ad hoc decisions/trial steering committee with independent memebrship
- Runing the trial: trial is more "varibale" -> error prove system, robust central system, more quality control and validation take additional time and resources.

<!--- A lot of experience about AD has been published--->
<!--- Don't re-invent the wheel. Find those giants, and step on their should hard!--->

Definitions:
  - Integrity: "Integrity means ensuring that trial data and processes have not been compromised, e.g. minimising information leakage at the interim analyses [13]."
  - Validity: "Validity implies there is an assurance that the trial answers the original research questions appropriately, e.g. by using methods that provide accurate estimates of treatment effects [14] and correct p values [15â€“17] and confidence intervals (CIs) for the treatment comparisons [18, 19]."
